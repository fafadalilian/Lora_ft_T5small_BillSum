# Fine-Tuning T5-Small with LoRA on California State Bills

## Project Overview

This project fine-tunes the T5-small model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the California state bill subset of the BillSum dataset. The goal of this fine-tuning process is to create a model capable of summarizing complex legislative documents efficiently, with a focus on bills from the California state legislature.

## Project Details

### Model

- **Base Model:** T5-small
- **Fine-Tuning Technique:** Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
- **Task:** Text Summarization of California State Bills

### Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** [BillSum Dataset](https://github.com/FiscalNote/BillSum)
  - **Subset:** California state bills
- **Purpose:** The dataset includes a collection of U.S. Congressional and California state bills, with corresponding summaries. For this project, we focused on the California state bills to fine-tune the model for summarizing state-level legislative documents.
